1. boxed() : The boxed() method is useful when you need to perform operations that require streams of objects (boxed types) instead of primitives.
For example, you might want to use methods like map, filter, or reduce that expect streams of objects. In such cases, you can first convert the stream of primitives to a stream of boxed objects using the boxed() method.
